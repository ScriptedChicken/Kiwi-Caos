**Playing cards:**

    • There is no limit as to the amount of actions that can be played in a turn, but items can only be used once per turn. 
    • If you don't want to or can't play any more actions, then continue to the next step.

**Movement:**

    • The number of sqaures in which you can move is equal to the sum of the two rolled dice.
    • You can only move through the stream by crossing a bridge. (*)
    • You can move through other players but you may not stop in the same square as them.
    • You collect all of the game tokens in a square by passing through or stopping on that square. (*) 

**...apart from cards that change this.*

**Types of cards:**

    • Actions - These cards preform a specific action to a player. They have specific instructions about their effects and requirements.

    • Items - These cards give you strong powers during a number of rounds. You may only have one item equiped at a time. If you want to change the item you have equiped then you must discard your current item.

**Morale:**

The scale of moral shows the morale of your team of workers. Your level of morale allows you to play certain powerful cards. In general, a low level of morale will give you quick benefits but will increase the risk of losing more. A high level of morale is harder to obtain, but will give you more steady benefits.
